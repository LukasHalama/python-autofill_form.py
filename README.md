# Google Form Autofiller

A simple Python script that automatically fills out Google Forms using Playwright and the OpenAI API.

It opens a form in your browser, reads the questions, uses GPT to generate short answers, fills them in, and submits the form.  
Built mostly for fun and to experiment with browser automation.
